🧪 EaseMath: Simple Web Toolkit for Math

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to EaseMath—a collection of simple, distraction-free web tools designed to make common mathematical tasks quick and easy.

I built this project to practice my HTML, CSS (using Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript skills by creating genuinely useful, single-page web applications. Think of it as a small, growing lab of math utilities!

🚀 The Tools Included

All the tools in this repository are separate HTML files. You can find their code in this repo and check out the live demo links (once this repository is published via GitHub Pages!).

Home Page (index.html): This is the main landing page that helps you navigate and learn about the other tools.

Base Converter (base-converter.html): Quickly converts numbers between different numerical bases (like Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Octal).

Equation Root Solver (equation-root-solver.html): Solves for the roots of polynomial equations (handling Quadratic and Cubic formulas).

Equation Grapher (equation-grapher.html): Allows you to input an equation and visualize a basic graph of the function.

Matrix Calculator (matrix-calculator.html): Performs fundamental matrix operations (like addition, subtraction, and multiplication).

🛠️ Technology Stack

This entire project is built using fundamental web technologies, making it easy for anyone to read and contribute to:

HTML5: The core structure of every page.

Tailwind CSS: Used for all modern, utility-first styling (makes it look nice!).

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): All the calculation logic and DOM manipulation is handled with plain JavaScript—no large frameworks needed!

🙏 Feedback & Suggestions

Since I'm just starting out, any feedback on the code structure, efficiency, or design is hugely appreciated!

If you find a bug, please open an Issue.

If you have an idea for a new simple math tool, let me know!

Thanks for checking out the project! Happy coding (and calculating)!
